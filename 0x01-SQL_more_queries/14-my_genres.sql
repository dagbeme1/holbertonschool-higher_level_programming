-- script that uses the hbtn_0d_tvshows database to lists all genres of the show Dexter
-- tv_shows table contains only one record where title = Dexter (but the id can be different)
-- each record should display: tv_genres.name
-- results must be sorted in ascending order by the genre name
-- can use only one SELECT statement
-- the database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command

SELECT g.`name`
  FROM `tv_genres` AS g

       ON g.`id` = s.`genre_id`

       INNER JOIN `tv_shows` AS t
       ON t.`id` = s.`show_id`
       WHERE t.`title` = "Dexter"
 ORDER BY g.`name`;
